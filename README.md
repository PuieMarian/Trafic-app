# Project Title

Peep learning application for urban traffic analysis

## Summary
Creating a way to solve the problem of intense urban traffic by combining satellite images and artificial intelligence with the help of which I want to extract traffic data. It is interesting because I have the opportunity to make a contribution in solving the intense traffic problem in Romania.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
-solve the problem of intense urban traffic;
-it is very common not only in Romania also in other big cities;
-my personal motivation is contributig at my phd final thesys;
-I have the opportunity to make a contribution in solving the intense traffic problem in Romania.



## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?
The data I will use was collected by someone else such as Here Technologies and the Ministry of Transport.
This solution is needed in remote sensingand GIS(Geographical Information Sistems).
The users of final application


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
